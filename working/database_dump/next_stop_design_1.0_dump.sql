With regards the staffed shop, the intentions are to deter vandalism and provide a stepchange in passenger facilities (e.g. advice on the right tickets, help during service disruption). I admit to being uncertain whether it is entirely necessary - perhaps a mobile catering van could serve passengers in the morning peak? I\'ve seen it happen at a local railway station.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, the wall structure is formed from: 1.75m concrete, 1.75m glass, 1.5m glass doors and 1.5m coloured (all 3m high). Each section uses a combination of these e.g. the central waiting area uses 4 concrete panels, 4 glass and 4 doors. Larger order quantities (e.g. for other stops) of these panels may lead to bulk-buying economies. I will certainly consider the use of curtain walls to prevent damage, and perhaps shuttered concrete may be more appealing visually.\r\n\r\nRegarding the coloured finishes, some good points have been made. Paint is perhaps most practical, since most materials will eventually deteriorate (e.g. discolouration, graffiti) and need refreshing - paint seems a sensible option since it can be covered and replaced with different colours in line with the fashion at the time.\r\n\r\nI will revise the design over the next few weeks, and I appreciate the comments, keep them coming.

Blutdrache is right, natural does not mean sustainable.   tree bark and stones will not stay on a curved green roof because of gravity.   incorporating a system that would hold loose pebbles and bark shavings in place would probably be too elaborate and expensive for a repeatable bus stop system. that\'s why green rooves are usually comprised of grass.   the grass absorbs moisture controlling the flow of storm water, and grass roots bind the soil/base together.   no point building a cheap green roof if it doesnt do anything, and no point having an expensive one if it costs the city too much.  a grass roof is a noble gesture, but tree bark probably wont work here.  the curve would require that the timber go through a process of glu-lamination, adding to the cost, incorporating unnatural adhesives that could not be burned as you suggest due to potentially toxic chemicals in the glue.   the roof structure, being accessible, would need to be able to support 20-30 people on it at any given time, which is do-able given its arched form, but is a problem that you, as designer, introduced.  it just  creates problems for you and your client that don\'t need to be there, so making the roof accessible might need some justification.   as i mentioned to someone else, the wifi thing is irrelevant.   every design here could have it, so what? its not a design concern.   that glass is extremely expensive, way beyond the budget of a city run transit company, but at least you\'re looking forward.   also if it allows only 10% of light through it, it might be ok on the inside, but will appear dark from the outside, and will therefore be uninviting. It will be much like trying to see into a house through net curtains in the middle of the day, you wont see a thing.   finally, there are a number of assumptions that natural, old-fashioned construction techniques cost less.   they don\'t, and that\'s why they aren\'t used more, and this economic barrier is one of the main obstacles to the environmental movement.   but it looks quite nice and it got me thinking, so thanks for that.','','',0,84,'Design',226,'2009-07-25 17:33:12','2009-07-25 17:33:12',NULL),(368,'','that roof will not work.   fact.','','',0,72,'Design',226,'2009-07-25 17:51:23','2009-07-25 17:51:23',NULL),(369,'','kavbar - thanks for the comment, ill show you what im trying to experiment on for this design, its something i learnt during my holiday.

This project, among many others on this site, is a perfect example.

The concrete (high CO2 producing material) and asphalt (petroleum based) would have to be replaced. You can argue recycleability about the PVC and the concrete and asphalt being removed, but the asphalt and concrete only become aggregate, not their original material. So those are down-cycled. And the PVC not only requires lots of energy to recycle, it produces chlorine gas (a common WWI chemical weapon).

The idea of using a tree started out as an aesthetical idea, and then developed as I liked the idea of it promoting more tree plantations that could possibly be used in design for the future. \r\nThe choice to use PVC was due to the fact that it is less brittle than glass and less likely to break, reducing maintenance. Glass could quite easily be used as an alternative. The concrete and asphalt that would need to be dug up wouldn\'t all need to be replaced either, surely it would be mostly replaced with soil for the trees roots? Some could be re-used as the hardcore layer on top of the soil too. I believe there is a more environmentally friendly concrete available too now (although I don\'t know if this is greenwash!) that could be used for the top layer of ground replacement.

Like previous commenters, however, I have concerns about the practicality of the idea.  (a) It depends on dedicated maintenance staff to \"loosen the bolts\" to allow for tree growth.  Do you really trust the folks on the ground in SLC (or anywhere) to do this? (b) If I understand correctly, the structural integrity of the stop depends on the health of the tree.  But I\'m sure you\'ve noticed that urban trees don\'t always succeed.  What happens when the tree fails, right when I\'m waiting for the bus?  (c) Mature tree transplants are indeed possible.  But have you priced any lately?  For a tree of a caliper like you\'re showing, you\'re talking well over $10,000.  For an urban situation, probably more.  I just can\'t see UTA shelling that out for mere aesthetics.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I think you\'re really on to something.  Why not incorporate a newly-planted tree or trees into the structure, while not requiring the trees to provide structural stability?','','',0,134,'Design',769,'2009-08-25 01:24:22','2009-08-25 01:24:22',NULL),(752,'','Thanks for the feedback. Firstly, I agree with the fact that having a tree incorporated into a design in such a way raises a few questions about maintenance, structure etc. In fact, a lot of the feedback I\'ve had has basically been questions about trees and not even mentioning the design! a) I don\'t feel maintenance would too much of a difficult task. The steel clamp would be supported from the ground so when it is loosened there would be no movement. The support is removed afterwards, job done!\r\nb) I can\'t see the tree simply failing and snapping one day without warning. A tree has more chance of being uprooted than it does failing structurally. If there were any problems arising such as rotting, it would be seen well in advance. c) I didn\'t really think about budget for this project, as there isn\'t one given in the brief (so creativity isn\'t limited). I agree with you wholly if it really is that much, I can\'t see UTA being wiling to spend that much. However, I have done a little research and one company quotes $175 per caliper inch of the tree (plus costs of planting etc.) I think at a push, it could rise to $4000.\r\nYour comments about perhaps planting a new tree to use as part of the design are interesting, and it could be a fantastic idea to have a tree growing throughout the life-span of a piece of design. For my design proposal, however, I can\'t see it working. Take away the tree concept (a tree used as structure) from my design, and your left with quite an average design. The rest of the stop was purposefully left very simple, to emphasize the trees importance to the structure and design.

So it happens. The tree would be very expensive to plant; on top of the debatable caliper cost there is also the cost of tearing out sidewalk and road, which, despite one of your responses, would need to be replaced.

I, being a frequnt public transport user,can challange everyone stating it as a functional design. As a user, I want a bus stop to facilitate me and turn my wait for the bus a bearable act and not distract me with plasma screen. By enclosing it and providing it with plasma screen, you are facilitating homeless people a nice place to stay at, students to smoke at and hiding place for bunking, which i am afraid is not what it is intended for. Other thing is that from outside, it seemed more like fuel/CNG station present here in our country.\r\n\r\nother thing which is very confusing for me is the providing of bicycle parking along with your waiting area. By doing this\r\nit would become a place for teenagers to park their bicycles outside it and enjoy doing inside whatever they want to do, and you know well what they want to do. If you know what i mean.\r\n\r\nFrom inside, it looks more like an informal sitting space like Cafe etc. with which i don\'t have much issues but I have issues with the sitting which is highly uncomfortable(those solid boxes), atleast for me.\r\nMoreover in your second image, the postures of people are strong point in justifyng my above mentioned opinion that it would not be used by persons waiting for bus but by people looking for a place for resting and other such activities but not for waiting for bus. So how can it be called \"Highly Functional\". I think you should first understand the real function of a bus stop and then analyze it again.\r\nCan someone explain to me that from where is this design \"ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL FREINDLY AND PURPOSE MADE\" as commented by MR.

The mission of the university fits well with this concept. Utah State has created a master planning process composed of seven principles to consider.\r\n \r\n1. A lively campus; a magnet for student, faculty, staff and public life\r\n2. State of the art facilities to support the university’s mission for teaching, research and public life\r\n3. A setting to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and interaction\r\n4. Campus as a destination for the public\r\n5. Functional and sustainable transportation\r\n6. Capitalize on the natural landscape setting, and\r\n7. Leadership in environmental stewardship\r\n\r\nA campus bus stop was developed with these principles in mind. In order to achieve an interdisciplinary collaboration and interaction, the idea arose to use LCD screens to present information to the public regarding campus activities. Sustainable efforts were used in several ways to follow with the mission of the university. Photovoltaic panels are installed to power the LCD screen and other energy the building may need for its water fixtures. Water collection is a large part of the sustainable design of the bus stop. Pervious paving materials were used to permit water to enter a cistern by virtue of the porous nature or large spaces in the material. The structure was slanted in areas to allow the water to flow into a cistern underneath an above ground water fixture. From this cistern, water is then pumped when necessary to irrigate the surrounding landscape. To create a pleasant environment, the building is oriented so that the sun is both exposed and concealed from the interior of the structure. This orientation enables the building to have warm areas in the cold winter months and cools areas in the hot summer months. Landscaping is used to create a fun destination for the public and a welcoming entrance to the structure. Together, all of these principles set up an ideal lively campus environment.\r\n','','',0,220,'Design',1584,'2009-09-16 06:02:28','2009-09-16 06:02:28','72.207.233.208'),(1428,'','very interesting communal space; I like the white and the complexity but may be a bit too complex in the day to day usage.\r\nUwe R.

Thin tubular framing and clear tempered or plexi-glass panels will provide ample viewing through the structure. This enclosed area will be approximately 20’ long and 8’ deep.\r\n  The curve of the structure is designed to shed rain and snow easily. The walls of the shelter will end 6” above the sidewalk allowing air flow into the shelter. Summer heat will dissipate out quickly while blocking direct winter winds.   \r\n  New disabled driver parking spaces will be placed behind the structure and a new 1:15 curb cut will provide access to the sidewalk and bus stop from the parking lot. The shelter will provide various height seating and an open space to comfortably accommodate a wheelchair user. The bus schedules will be posted at two heights on either side of the central sign board. There will also be a “talking schedule” mounted on the sign board with speech recognition. A person with a visual impairment will touch a button and speak either the route number or the destination to find when the next bus is due.

The bus stop is an enclosed structure with two entryways, one on the east side and one on the west side. Just behind the entryways is a tall clear glass or Plexiglas wind-breaker (View Image 3.3) to stop wind from entering either entryway. The wind-breakers also keep snow and rain from blowing into the shelter. In addition to the shelter two benches would be placed out side under the trees to the east of the existing bus shelter (View Image 3.4). During the warmer weather the windows on both the north and south side of the structure can be opened to allow for fresh breezes to circulate throughout the station \r\n(View Images 3.1- 3.2).\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n\r\nThe purposed shelter is positioned right up to the sidewalk, which is 10 feet wide. Currently the sidewalk bulbs out as the road curves which puts the bus station 17ft away from the street. By trimming down the sidewalk the extra room can be given a bus only section.  Between UTA and the U of U Shuttles the business loop at the University of Utah is a high traffic area for buses. Considering the width of the roadway, sidewalks and parking there is potentially room for bus only lanes. (For Specs View Image 1.1-1.3)\r\n	\r\nThe height of the shelter at its lowest point is 7ft, the roof height in the front is 9ft and the back is 7ft 7inches. The shelter is mostly made of glass and is highly transparent which keeps current view corridors and allows for new ones as well.\r\n\r\nAccess\r\n\r\nAt the back end (south side) of the shelter the curb slants down allowing wheelchair accessibility from the parking lot to the bus station and cub side. All bus route information can be posted on the wind barriers for both UTA and the U of U shuttle routes (View Image 2.1-2.2).\r\n\r\nSurfaces\r\n\r\nThe purposed ground surface is concrete because of its cost and durability. Tactile ground surfaces would be implemented at bus loading zones for those who are seeing impaired.\r\n\r\nHuman\r\n\r\nThe current bus stop offers one bench with room for one-two individuals. The purposed station has four large benches and one small bench. Depending on size and personal space the station can seat fifteen to twenty people, plus room for one wheelchair. Two additional benches would be positioned under the trees on the east end of the structure and the current bus stop sign would be moved west, close the benches. These benches would add another six to eight seats available to transit riders. The purposed station also includes a covered bike rack, which is positioned in the front of the structure.\r\n\r\n',62,'2009-06-15 21:18:21','2009-07-02 16:52:53','Image_one.jpg','image/jpeg',158540,'2009-06-15 21:17:41','Image_two.jpg','image/jpeg',189003,'2009-06-15 21:17:58','Image_three.jpg','image/jpeg',154586,'2009-06-15 21:18:12',36,NULL),(41,'Lounge','This bus stop is all about being comfy while you wait.',68,'2009-06-15 22:09:37','2009-06-15 22:09:37','bus_stop_design.jpg','image/jpeg',3030,'2009-06-15 22:09:37',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,37,NULL),(42,'University of Utah Teepee','     I designed this to create a fun and very different bus stop on the campus of the University of Utah.

The curve glass could create more space for people to stand to not get overcrowded and track the sound from the outside. Also with wide space and curve chair to make more available seats for many people. The bus stop also has windows and could be a shelter in rainy days.

I apologize for the lengthy explanation, and for the cheesy name.\r\n\r\nThe most important aspect is shelter that provides an optimal, self-regulated climate year round. A bus stop that is extremely cold during the winter months or hot during the summer months is not especially useful, and could discourage use of the system. This bus stop is designed to provide a shaded, cool haven for riders in the summer and a warm oasis in the winter, using renewable technologies that require little maintenance. \r\n\r\nFor all seasons, a solar array atop the structure (oriented somewhat southward to capture the maximum sunlight) would gather and store energy to power the stop’s lights, as well as fans during the summer and heating system during the winter. During summer months, solar energy collected by the rooftop array powers a set of small fans which would help to remove hot air from the interior of the shelter, bringing fresh cooler air in through the door openings as well as through small tubular vents near the floor of the shelter. The fans would force the heated air out and bring the cooler air upwards, resulting in more comfort for the user. Alternatively, the fans could be turned off and passively used as turbines, spinning with the flow of the hot air escaping the structure and complementing the energy being stored from the solar array. A clear roof is shielded from the sun by a blooming deciduous hedge, which grows with the spring (and increasing sun) to provide shade for users inside the shelter.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months, energy stored from the solar array is utilized to operate a radiant heating floor, which occupies much of the bus stops bottom layer. The radiant heat would rise from the floor to provide a dry, nonslip floor surface and a warm atmosphere for riders, and could optionally be extended to provide radiant heat for those seated on the bench as well. The deciduous hedge would lose its leaves as the temperature drops, which allows more sunlight to penetrate the clear ceiling, providing further passive heat inside. The tubular vents near the floor would aid in drainage from the shelter of melting water from users’ boots during snowy or icy weather. Finally, the side walls of the entryway, as well as the wide middle support post, provide not only support to the mechanisms on the rooftop, but also an extra buffer from cold winds.\r\n\r\nFrom a safety perspective, large windows on all sides of the shelter provide excellent visibility into and out of the shelter, and solar energy stored during the day operates high efficiency LED light panels during service hours both inside the shelter and outside. The planter boxes on the rooftop work double duty as an extra shade from sun or snow but also as battery storage and a light fixture for the entrance of the shelter. An emergency telephone could easily be attached to the shelter, and a wi-fi accesspoint would be incorporated into the structure itself, for the convenience of those waiting with laptops or PDAs.\r\n\r\nTo best share service information to waiting riders, a map of each route is displayed on the inside walls of the shelter. There is also ad space available around the interior walls of the bus stop, to help support the costs of bus stop construction and maintenance, as well as providing a minor revenue stream for the system at large. A tone sounds and two lights on the center post alert riders by flashing when any bus is approaching (which light depends on the direction from which the bus is coming), and the placard with the route number also lights up when the corresponding bus is approaching. Such a system assumes a GPS-linked transportation network.\r\n\r\nTo ensure accessibility to all users, the raised floor is accessed by a gently sloping ramp, which is also colored bright yellow and covered in a bumpy textured surface, both to alert visually impaired users to the ramp but also to slow the speed of a wheelchair descending the ramp from within the shelter. The bench inside is cut off to allow one wheelchair a comfortable amount of space within the climate-controlled shelter. Finally, an audible tone would accompany the approach of any bus, and the route number would be spoken by a computerized voice to help visually impaired users (and others) identify the arriving bus.\r\n\r\nFinally, from an aesthetic point of view, the station is designed to match the colors of the UTA system for maximum recognition as a UTA stop, and the rooftop plants blooming during the summer, and large windows during the winter would provide a pleasant atmosphere in which to wait for a ride. The large windows would also make it easier for bus drivers to see passengers waiting in the shelter, so riders (esp. handicapped) would not necessarily have to step outside to flag the bus until they are ready to board. I did not include a trash facility in the bus stop’s design itself due to potential smells detracting from waiting riders’ comfort, but a single-stream recycling bin as well as a garbage can could be provided nearby (and downwind). \r\n',123,'2009-07-01 20:26:41','2009-07-24 20:59:09','bus_stop_1a.jpg','image/jpeg',432389,'2009-07-01 20:26:34','bus_stop_2a.jpg','image/jpeg',376204,'2009-07-01 20:26:37','bus_stop_3a.jpg','image/jpeg',371952,'2009-07-01 20:26:39',44,NULL),(52,'functional HUB','function hub\r\nGenerate a bus stop which integrates numerous additional functions, which are usually spread in public city spaces – as vending machines, information desks, time pieces, recycling stations, …\r\nThe functions are not simply add-ons, but integrated into the overal design.

There is a  genuine opportunity here to give public transit a real moral high ground in an age of ecological awareness.   To  this end, we must preceed the question of \'what should a new bus stop be?\' with the more poignant question, \'do  we need a new bus stop in the first place?\'.   This is the most sustainable approach of all.\r\n\r\n\r\nReuse over Rebuild:\r\n\r\nI attempted to demonstrate these ideas by looking specifically at the existing site at the University of Utah,  listed as being the initial site for redevelopment.   I studied the existing structure to see how it might be  reused, only removing what I deemed to be truly worthless.   Five of the existing columns and two of the concrete  walls were retained, as concrete is one of the most useless materials once demolished.   This retained structure  would then support a new roof structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Part Intervention:\r\n\r\nThis redesign is composed of two parts - a roof and a screen.   The idea is that one part, probably the roof, is  used as a coherent means of corporate identity for the UTA, making all UTA stops instantly recognisable.   The  other part may vary greatly from stop to stop, individual pieces of eco-sculpture designed by emerging designers  looking for a means of expression.   Simultaneously, it is an expression of UTA\'s commitment to healthier design  and a commitment to aid young talent achieve the american dream in a time of utter hopelessness.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreen:\r\n\r\nThe screen I have designed here is composed of reconstituted glass fins.   They provide a certain amount of  shading and shelter, while not completely enclosing the commuters.   It allows the wind to pass through it like a  sieve, slowing down wind speeds without creating a wind tunnel.   It also provides for specific integrated  functions, such as seating and bicycle locking, reducing the material palette.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoof:\r\n\r\nUsing an asymmetrical load distribution in the roof, placing all of the weight over the columns, it is possible  to achieve large cantilevering spans.   This weight comes in the form of a solar panel generator, that takes  advantage of Utah\'s prolonged sunshine hours to create a self-sufficient bus hub.   By taking in the solar  radiation during the day, the roof can be lit at night.   This light radiates from a reconstituted plastic  \'lantern\' that wraps around the perimeter of the roof structure.   This plastic box is made to be as lightweight  as possible, and the remaining gap in the roof is filled with an etfe membrane or \'pillow\', another lightweight  and recyclable material, that is more transparent than glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessories:\r\n\r\nMany of the designs for this competition so far have tried to integrate bins and vending machines into the stop  itself.   I have deliberately tried to avoid this, as these are commercial elements that are constantly embroiled  in evolutionary flux.   Their design and technology may change very quickly in the coming years.   This could  leave the bus stop feeling very dated, as it will be either complicated or expensive to upgrade these integrated  components.   Maintanence of standalone accessories is also much easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisibility/Security:\r\n\r\nThe considerable size of this shelter design, due to the anticipated large numbers of morning and evening student  & teacher commuters, makes it highly visible, and the large black \'UNIVERSITY\' tag makes it instantly  understandable to visitors, day and night.   The reason for lighting the bus stop so dramtically is so that it  becomes a visible beacon at night, a safe illuminated shelter distinguished from standard street lamps.   The  lighting should also discourage homeless people from moving in (the sensitivity of how to deal with the homeless  problem does not change the fact that public transport may be considered unsafe or \'low-brow\' if homeless people  are encouraged to sleep in bus shelters).   Finally, I have left a gap in the screen, primarily allowing access  to the car park, but also providing a means of escape should some thug attempt a mugging, or something equally  undesirable.',174,'2009-07-08 21:37:11','2009-07-08 21:37:11','stage_1_copy.jpg','image/jpeg',1129560,'2009-07-08 21:36:35','comp_test_4.jpg','image/jpeg',2057335,'2009-07-08 21:36:44','20090708135012_15h26m26s_copy.jpg','image/jpeg',507579,'2009-07-08 21:37:07',55,NULL),(63,'Bus Station Utah','Well This is just an idea for bus stations.i havent done much to make it nicer only for showing my idea.\r\nThanks ',223,'2009-07-09 15:14:49','2009-07-14 15:48:00','Bus_station.jpg','image/jpeg',253918,'2009-07-09 15:14:45','Bus_station_001_.jpg','image/jpeg',307481,'2009-07-09 15:14:47',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,56,NULL),(65,'Modular',':: Architecture\r\nThe stop uses a modular construction, using prefabricated concrete and glass panels.

The design encompasses the aspects of Organic Design by the use of materials in their natural states and colors and also by the structure’s fluid form. \r\n\r\nThe base of the bus stop is set at an angle to the street to allow users greater visibility of oncoming traffic. The base was designed to be either native stone or discarded concrete block pieces stacked horizontally. The theory was to create enough of a texture that it deters graffiti. Between the base columns stretches a curved bench made of wood. The wood could either be treated or a species that is naturally resistant to decay. Composite wood is also an option. The wood is a nice warm and soft contrast to the hard rough base columns. It provides comfort in the area where the user comes in contact with the structure.\r\n\r\nDepending on the site, the bus stop might need a wind break behind the bench. This could be a clear polycarbonate panel as shown in the rendering or a wooden slat wall. The benefit to the clear polycarbonate is that it allows the user clear view of activity behind them which results in greater safety. \r\n\r\nThe roof structure is composed of two curved beams separated by a ribbon of glass. The roof is set perpendicular to the street which means that it is offset from the base. This gives the structure a sense of movement and direction.  The ribbon skylight allows natural light into the structure while still providing protection from the elements. The roof itself sits above the walls on steel columns sticking out of the base. This lifts the roof up giving the appearance of it floating above the structure. \r\n\r\nThe roof was originally designed to be wood shingles. By decking the structure with treated stats, air would be allowed to flow around the shingles keeping them from rotting. This is much like old barns who still have their original wood shingles on them today. If designed correctly, maintenance should not be a problem. Another option would be concrete shingles that would keep the same look and feel yet be completely maintenance free.\r\n',235,'2009-07-11 04:32:18','2009-07-14 15:48:00','Organic_Bus_Stop.jpg','image/jpeg',1641671,'2009-07-11 04:32:09','Organic_Bus_Stop_Drawings.jpg','image/jpeg',592797,'2009-07-11 04:32:13','Busstop_007.jpg','image/jpeg',38807,'2009-07-11 04:32:17',60,NULL),(68,'Continuous Ribbon','The design concept takes the shape of a continuous \"ribbon\", made out of cross laminated timber and painted in a water proof glossy red.

Furthermore, as every urban structure has not only a utilitarian duty but also an aesthetic one, we have kept our lights tucked into the deep roof to reduce the bus stop\'s contribution to urban light pollution, but filled all sides of the curvy roof pediments with clear glass to guarantee the shelter still provides an ambient glow as a beacon for evening travelers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have designed LED banks in the easily accessible rear glass panels, providing a perfect place for schedule posting, public notices, and other important documents, which can be double-printed (an enormous paper-saver over time) and inserted into the protective glass panels for increased durability.\r\n\r\nThe spaces between our columns have been left open and high for seasonal hangings: small planted flower baskets in the spring, bright and cheerful holiday ornaments in winter, patriotic festoons in summer--the possibilities are endless, limited only by community imagination and democratic consensus.\r\n\r\nWaiting for the bus often provides travelers with an opportunity to \"stop and smell the roses,\" so to speak--and for this reason, we believe a bus stop that is tastefully rich in detail will be of unrivaled benefit to those thoughtful and sensitive citizens who enjoy observing life, tracing the world with their eyes and minds when the frantic pace of the daily grind finally grinds to a halt.

The key changes regard the modular structure and retail provision. The intention is to provide a comfortable, hard-wearing stop. Passengers should be able to wait for their rush-hour services with space to sit and stand in safety and out of the rain, wind or heat. Good passenger information and facilities are vital for both commuting students and staff, and long-distance passengers wishing to change services. On a wider scale, can a bus stop provide additional services and features which could develop into a focal point for the area, providing facilities for the public and thus improving the passenger experience? I hope this design can effectively fulfil those demands, make a positive impact; please excuse the lengthy explanation (it\'s nearly as long as War and Peace). Once again I welcome comments.\r\n:: Architecture\r\nThe stop draws inspiration from modern transport architecture and design and is much more relaxing in appearance compared with the previous design. The architecture is inspired by Harlow Town Railway Station, designed in the late 1950s and a good example of architecture from the period. The materials at the bus stop are more modern though, using thick wooden panels (which should develop a rough and natural appearance with age) and charcoal-coloured frames. Signage is in Helvetica, and details are in a deep blue, inspired by British Rail’s 1960s rebranding. The reasoning behind the somewhat retro inspiration is that they have stood the test of time quite well – that should make the bus stop less prone to appearing outdated and unfashionable over the years.\r\n:: Operations\r\nPassenger seating is mostly separate from the platforms, to allow easier alighting and boarding given the large number of services calling at the stop. 2 platforms allow multiple buses to stop simultaneously, thus reducing waiting and improving journey times. A Ticket Vending Machine allows fares to be paid beforehand, reducing the need for the driver to spend valuable time selling tickets.\r\n:: Modular construction\r\n2 key components are used: 12.5cm thick support posts, and a 150cm frame. This frame is split into thirds horizontally, with different infill panels depending upon the use – window panels can be opened, door panels have fixed windows and solid panels use wood. The frame is used in both doors and windows – in the doors lightweight glass is used for ease of opening, in the windows thicker glass is used; this opens for ventilation. Glass is laminated for safety and coated in heat resistant film.\r\nThe modular components could in theory be used to build multiple structures. Larger waiting rooms would be feasible at bus stations, smaller open shelters would suit suburban stops. Sympathetic materials can be used in different locations when required.\r\n:: Passenger information\r\nSummary of departure screens list the next few bus services. Next Bus indicators closer to the platforms provide in-depth journey information, as well as live details about bus progress. These screens are freestanding, allowing for replacement upon damage or life expiry, and are housed in tough metal cases. Automated audio announcements provide additional information and are benefit to the visually impaired.\r\n(don’t worry, only 296 words left to go)\r\n:: Passenger comfort\r\nDuring cold, snowy or windy conditions, a waiting room is provided. Temperature is controlled using opening windows and forced air recirculation. Inside, passengers can take a seat on tough metal benches and perches. Outside, additional seats are provided and up to 12 cycles can be parked, all monitored by CCTV. A drinking fountain allows passengers to cool down in hot weather. Energy saving fluorescent spotlights and strip-lights are used throughout – these should last some time before replacement is needed. Large canopies provide shade and protection from the rain.\r\n:: Disability provision\r\nDoors are 1.5m wide, sufficient to allow wheelchair access. They are highlighted with blue paint. One door can be opened automatically, and one perch seat can be folded down to create a wheelchair space. The platform is raised to allow easier boarding and disembarking. \r\n:: Retail\r\nWith the old design, a point of controversy was a retail shop. This is now gone, instead space has been provided outside for retailers to allow greater flexibility. For instance, a coffee van could serve morning commuters, a snack bar could serve the lunchtime rush, and the evening newspaper can be distributed during the evening peak. Supply can be tailored better to daily and seasonal demand, and should services prove excessive, they can be cut back. With mobile units, stockholding space and overnight security will be less of an issue. Multiple businesses can be supported, important during these turbulent economic times.\r\n:: Development\r\nTrees and shrubs have been planted to provide aesthetic appeal, and to compensate for environmental damage. Given the large usage of the stop, leisure developments e.g. benches, tables, gardens etc. would be convenient for many people, and the space as a whole can develop further, with the upshot of improving the passenger experience.\r\n',230,'2009-07-29 21:56:34','2009-08-03 16:01:42','Overview.png','image/png',279496,'2009-07-29 21:56:27','Detail_1.png','image/png',556330,'2009-07-29 21:56:30','Detail_2.png','image/png',503367,'2009-07-29 21:56:32',81,NULL),(97,'PUNTO','Punto is the literal translation of \"Stop\" in Italian.

These various positions are carved and imprinted into a single box; thereby distinguishing it from a conventional bus stop. The intention is to create a visually appealing structure which would be perceived as a piece of art and design rather than just a simple shelter simultaneously rendering practicality and comfort. \r\n\r\nThis \"Punto\" design is just another stop, on our way of re-designing, re-thinking and igniting a renewed interest into the everyday public services and spaces which we often go unnoticed and have become mundane and obsolete.\r\n',218,'2009-07-30 19:35:51','2009-07-30 19:35:51','Punto_1_NB.jpg','image/jpeg',604174,'2009-07-30 19:35:39','Punto_2_copy.jpg','image/jpeg',702349,'2009-07-30 19:35:44','Punto_3_copy.jpg','image/jpeg',611754,'2009-07-30 19:35:47',82,NULL),(98,'Smart Bus Stop ','Practical, environmentally friendly, unique, and iconic. Smart Bus Stop is an innovative bus stop designed to improve Salt Lake City’s public transit experience.\r\n\r\nThe seats and roof is inspired by designer sofas. The philosophy behind the form is to have the exterior design convey the comfort that the user experiences in the interior, promoting more people to use public transit.  \r\n\r\nThe seating arrangement is based on the teepees traditionally used by the original inhabitants of Utah, the Ute tribe. The open, circular seating plan creates a sense of community for the city. \r\n\r\nTried and tested inflatable technology is used for the seats and roof. The form is cut by computer controlled CNC technology to give wrinkle free precision. Materials such as the Ferrari Precontraint 402 can be used as the skin. This material is made of fire retardant, UV stabilized material with high tenacity. The Texyloop process will make the skin completely recyclable, in order to benefit the environment. This technique also makes Smart Bus Stop one of the cheapest designs in the contest. \r\n\r\nSolar cells can be placed on top of the roof when the smart bus stop is placed in areas exposed to the sun to further demonstrate Smart Bus Stop’s commitment to the environment. The solar cells will power the multi-colored lights that are placed inside the translucent skin, creating a beautiful effect at night. \r\n\r\nA timetable is available for convenience, and there is a slot for advertisement in order to create a surplus in cash flow, allowing more bus stops to be built. The size of the Smart Bus Stop is modular and adjustable depending on the number of people using the bus stop at the specific site. To promote accessibility for all, the design is wheelchair accessible, includes multiple escape routes for safety, and includes remote infrared audible signage for the visually impaired.

Waiting a bus is like being in a bubble surrounded by other people in their own bubble, as if we were alone.\r\nAll societies are based on meeting and comprehension. Because it’s public and open to everybody, public transports can be a real support for society life, and bus stops can be social spaces.\r\n\r\nThe best way for people to meet and break distances is playing a game. So what is seating, what is leaning, what is resting, what is waiting ? They are ways to meet. In this bus stop, whatever you want to do needs two people. Seats are balances, so you have to be two to balance it, you can also lean on some elements but if you want to feel good you have to be two.\r\nA game is naturally beginning, and people have to communicate each other to find the best stability. By this way waiting a bus becomes a funny game in which people will play even if they don’t know each other.\r\n\r\nTo show it all the bus stop is like unstable, using scenography to animate the space and provide different feelings. Different areas, corresponding to different uses, are created by the move of the structure, expressing movement of the society.\r\nThe structure is created by a repetion and rotation of one steel strip, which length change. Some boxes becomes embedded in the structure to provide different functions like ticketing, food & drink dispensing, web and bus informations.\r\n\r\nThis bus stop is a real point of social life and happy time, using a game to establish communication between people without they never have spoke together.

Different spaces with different kind of music allow peoples to feel good, according to what they like (seating and listening classical music, dancing listening pop music, depending of their age and the kind of music they like).\r\nEye sense is also used, natural light is filtred by water on the roof (snow during the winter), giving different atmosphere.

My initial response was to remedy the current shelter, but since a bus cannot stop on a street curve, I decided to bring the shelter as close as possible to the bus pickup. I noticed the strip of grass right in front of the the bus stop sign was worn from waiting passengers. Since the entire length of the of grass has been worn, and because historically waiting passengers would prefer personal space together with a view to see oncoming busses, I decided to design a linear shelter on this strip of grass. In order to lessen the shelter’s footprint, I incorporated the existing trees in the shelter’s plan. Lastly, because the current shelter provided only limited seating, which in turn became cramped when more than a few waiting passengers were present, I designed seating that would undulate to create clusters. These seats would accommodate single passengers as well as groups of passengers simultaneously. \r\n\r\nThe extruded undulation of the seats also double as lateral strength for the south wall and the cantilevered canopy. The south wall provides voids for both views and ventilation, while the use of concrete is utilized to provide protection and to create a heat-sink to waiting passengers. As a result of the south facing wall, the concrete will shade and absorb heat by day, while releasing heat by night. The shelter is only partially fully cladded in glass due to Salt Lake City’s weather. January is the coldest month of the year; with an average temperature of 29.1 °F (-1.6 °C), cladding the shelter entirely would cause the shelter to overheat during the majority of the shelter’s usage. This shelter would book-end the existing shelter, which I propose not to be demolished but rather to be fitted to shelter bicycles and house a university emergency telephone post.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, a bus stop shelter must provide comfort for waiting passengers. Using opportunities and clues derived from the site, my response is: *The Site Specific Shelter.* A shelter detailed for Campus Center Drive, Utah.

We can solve this problem with considered material selection; for this Bus Stop Shelter the base and upstand and constructed from a dense material such as concrete with a high thermal mass, this enables the material to absorb the suns energy during the day time, it will draw more of the suns energy if it is coloured black, then, at night time when the temperature falls the concrete will radiate the heat which absorbed earlier. This creates a passive form of heating fueled by the sun.\r\n\r\nThe Roof of the shelter should be made of a much lighter weight material such as timber so that it can be filled with insulation, the underside should be reflective to bounce light and heat back down over the seating area. The roof should be fixed with an engineer designed steel structure that embeds in the concrete form.\r\nThe long seating area provides rest spots in the shade as well as in the open, and will be furnished with timber slats. Lighting can be installed in the floor in the form of low wattage LED clusters and can be joined to the mains street lighting circuit, the upwards thrown light can be bounced back down from the reflective underside of the canopy.\r\n \r\nThe design is a simple striking shape without fuss or detail, there are sufficient flat spaces to display travel route information and advertising.\r\nDue to the minimal pallet of materials it is possible to manufacture this bus stop in most places of the world, substituions can be made inb the concrete mix with, the help of an engineer, to include a wide variety of innovative building materials such as those suggested on my drawings, perhaps it could even be built in a strong form of adobe.\r\n\r\n',1013,'2009-09-08 08:41:22','2009-09-08 08:41:22','Next_Stop_sheet_3.JPG','image/jpeg',684847,'2009-09-08 08:41:06','Next_Stop_sheet_2.JPG','image/jpeg',48770,'2009-09-08 08:41:18','Next_Stop_sheet_1.JPG','image/jpeg',65313,'2009-09-08 08:41:21',170,'86.148.219.32'),(188,'\"CARE\"','This is my idea of how a bus stop can adapt with the weather and environment.

Stored water is used in the restrooms and to water nearby vegetation. The energy generated from the photovoltaic fabric is used to power the interactive glowing signals that alert students with bus is about to arrive.  The seating design maximizes seating by adapting a stadium style seating arrangement. Unlike regular stadium seats U stop seating allows people to sit in multiple positions such as cross-legged, leaned back, or stretched out. One of the main power sources for the U Stop is generated using the pavegen systems. The system generates energy from people walking. The pavegen blocks have been place in high areas of traffic such as in front of the library, at cross walks, by the stadium and most importantly at the bus station. This system not only generates power but it also increases student’s awareness of the bus stops.  In front of the stop in the crosswalk area the pavegens light up to indicate which bus is arriving.

By doing so, this design provides extended coverage space (90 linear feet) for the people needed. This space serves the people who need to take a rest and sit down and/or get out of the sun or harsh weather.  Also, it is slipped in right below the tree line.

At the new University of Utah transit HUB, commuters no longer have to sit staring off into space as they wait for the next bus to come by. GPS trackers offer real-time arrival data for all awaiting passengers to have an idea of how long they have to wait and an attached snack shop that offers coffee, candy, soda pop, and delicious cookies make the wait a little more bearable. Its location is also key to the convenience of this centrally located bus stop. It is located adjacent to the University’s visitor parking, it is aligned with a major thorough fare, and it a central node in the pedestrian linkage between the light rail stop to the southeast and the University quad to the northwest. This also makes it a prime spot for being more than a bus stop. It has the potential for being the break spot for more than the commuters who use it. Students and Faculty can use this to pick up their cup(s) of coffee or other refreshments between classes as well as a spot to congregate with other peers in the sitting area. The building’s form, with its 24’ high tower acts a beacon landmark from far around to draw in its users. \r\n\r\nLocated attached to the bus stop is a small 150 sq. ft. snack shop. It is intended to give the convenience of a vending machine but the personal interacting of a café. The snack shop is large enough to accommodate a coffee shop, candy and cold drinks, as well as delicious baked goods. The open air counter is exposed and engages to the public space directly in front of the shop along the main pedestrian path. It is a large enough open space to serve customers at the counter as others are passing through the space.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of having an attached for-profit retail space has many layers. I was most interested in two aspects that I felt can be to solution to problems that have plagued most bus stops: security and cleanliness. The first was the added eyes at the bus stop to provide a sense of security to the commuters. This would allow for more people to feel comfortable taking the bus who may have been uneasy about it prior. The second is the retail shop’s stake in the appearance and upkeep of the bus stop. Since it is a part of the retailer’s image and well as the transit authority’s, it would be a part of the retailer’s responsibility to maintain the area since they are ever present.\r\n\r\nIn my attempt to make a mixed use space that incorporated uses that may have varying hours of operation, there was the task of creating a solution that could function not only as barrier for after-hours security but to also keep  the spatial feel of unit as a whole. The result would have to give full access to the retail space during the day and at night still function as a landmark for those looking to ride the transit bus. The result was to take a segment of the wall from the rounded-plan snack shop and put it on guiding tracks. During the day the wall would be tucked away at the back of the counter where it would be out of the way leaving the front counter open to serve customers. After the snack shop has closed, the wall would be rolled around to in front of the counter to fully and securely enclose the store.

Since visitors to the campus are the main users of this bus stop, it is important that the new bus stop set the sustainable bar for what will soon be a fully sustainable campus. The design accomplishes this by becoming a living showcase for the energy used and produced by the bus stop. Firstly, the shape of the structure offers specific views so that the visitor is able to very clearly see the types of sustainable solutions offered by the design. The sustainable solutions include site orientation for both optimum solar rays and shading and solar panels to collect all of this energy. Secondly, within the bus stop there is an electronic system that measures how much energy is being harvested as well as how much is being used. Lastly, at the end of the day when the Blue Route Evening Shuttle Schedule comes into effect, the bus stop will use its conserved energy to stay lit to provide safety for its riders. \r\n	It is important to remember that the structure is first and foremost a bus stop. As such, within the structure and electronic system, the already existing Shuttle Tracker is implemented so that as riders approach the bus stop, they are already aware of how long they have to wait for the bus and can therefore decide to take a seat for a long wait or simply lean against the structure for a little rest before their bus arrives. \r\n\r\n',1370,'2009-09-09 20:18:21','2009-09-09 20:18:21','render2.JPG','image/jpeg',101448,'2009-09-09 20:18:16','render1.jpg','image/jpeg',180158,'2009-09-09 20:18:17','daytime.jpg','image/jpeg',281155,'2009-09-09 20:18:19',183,'130.39.0.211'),(201,'University of Utah Bus Stop','An exposed steel, structural system erects out of the earth with smooth curves and strong lines.

Bach. Regardless of genre, there is something unique to the addition of music to the rythmic nature of a commute. Sound became the driving force behind the design of this bus stop. \r\n\r\nThe University of Utah is the home of the Western Soundscape Archive. A Soundscape is defined by the Handbook for Acoustic Ecology as “an environment of sound with emphasis on the way it is preceived and understood by the individual, or by a society . . . Since a soundscape is shaped by both the conscious and subliminal perceptions of the listener, soundscape analysis is based on perceptual and cognitive attributes such as foreground, background, contour, rhythm, silence, density, space and volume . . . .”\r\n\r\nThe form of the bus stop was derived by exploiting graphs of the soundscape of some available data from Utah and then further manipulating those results to acheive a space condusive to heightening the experience of soundmaking. The space of the bus stop is designed as an informal performance space where music students from the University could practice their instrument in front of an audience rather than in a practice room within the school of music without the appreciation of any random passersby. \r\n\r\nMusically inclined students represent an incredibly small sampling of the sound emitting population of the campus. While the bus stop acts as the nexus of the project, the entire Sound Walk is meant to focus people’s attention upon the cacauphony of sounds that occur on campus on a daily basis that might be taken for granted and if given a little more consideration might be worth being appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this project is to engage in making place by use of heightening people’s auditory experience. By allowing people to take a few moments to consider the sound of the light rail train as it eases over the tracks or the sounds of leaves rustling in a nearby tree as a bird is in mid-song. The act of listening intently connects people to their place by making them aware of movement around them (since sound is merely the vibration of molecules of air at a frequency that is audible) and allows people to have the chance to appreciate a variety of sounds from things that might be otherwise considered as just noise to the bus stop that is dedicated to music.',1423,'2009-09-10 15:47:47','2009-09-10 15:47:47','NSD_1.jpg','image/jpeg',359368,'2009-09-10 15:47:41','NSD_2.jpg','image/jpeg',505909,'2009-09-10 15:47:43','NSD_3.jpg','image/jpeg',305215,'2009-09-10 15:47:45',192,'130.39.0.211'),(210,'COMMUNITY HUB BUS STOP','The concept of my design was to maximize the usage of the space available for the bus stop to make maximum covered seating for the large community that is associated withe the bus stop and its related activities.

This rod could be used as a handrail to help the elderly into and back up out of the bench inside.  This rod is seen again in the handrail ascending the stairs, and wrapping around the balcony.  The handrail on the stairway is located in the center in order to direct traffic of people entering or leaving the balcony.  Inside the structure I put a simple steel seat that extends the entire width of the shelter, I chose this design because it will allow passengers a place to rest between rides, and yet it will not be so inviting as to encourage the homeless to stay and cause problems, and deter others from using the space.  The entrance and exit of the shelter are on either side of the center console, and are 3 feet wide to allow handicap accessibility. ',1447,'2009-09-10 20:34:40','2009-09-10 20:34:40','Picture_3.png','image/png',408092,'2009-09-10 20:34:36','Picture_4.png','image/png',804001,'2009-09-10 20:34:38',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,194,'76.11.117.230'),(212,'DOMINOES bus station','This is my vision of the Utah State bus station.

As an object this structure was designed to very specifically fit into the exact location the bus stop is (both on campus and whereabouts in the city).  To drive the form the design of the structure took on a very conceptual thinking, which in turn yielded the final consideration - a symbiosis between interior and exterior space (where most bus stops focus solely on interior) \r\n\r\nConsidering weather conditions, location and the inevitable high-use volume the design adopts a sprawling structure which creates both interior and exterior space.  These two significantly different components (the internal space and external structure) create an effective symbiosis between interior and exterior space.  Adapting very specifically to the vast weather changes throughout the year, the enclosed structure keeps heat in during the cold winters and mild temperatures during the hot summers.  Coupled with the interior space is the bold exterior structure-which in its own right acts as a separate yet unified exterior space.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE:\r\n\r\nSUPPORT SYSTEM - The support structure derives its curves from the specific location the bus stop is on the campus.  From here these supports act as both structural support and a landscape element.  As a result each of the supports creates a mini-landscape of its own and thus a new exterior space is created where the support merges into the ground-plane.\r\n\r\nENCLOSED STRUCTURE - The enclosed structure creates the interior waiting area for the users. The front door is on sliders which allow the whole front end of the space to be opened up or completely closed-in turn this makes the interior and exterior space feel more like one continuing piece as opposed to two separate pieces.  Coupled with this is the use of seating which lines both in and outsides of the structure.\r\n\r\nCOLOR and WEATHER - The structure is a stark red and black structure, with white accent-specifically chosen to represent the University of Utah’s school colors.  When implemented into physical manifestations these abstract color representations adopt an organic form which erupts from the ground into support beams which simultaneously structurally hold the bus stop together and act as art pieces that can be seen from key spots throughout the campus.  Coupled with this is the stark contrast the beams will bring the structure amidst the snow-laden winter landscape - again acting as a sculptural art piece. \r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY:\r\n\r\nDIRECTION - Bold lines move form the middle interior space of the structure outwards towards the more prominent and most important buildings on campus.  This allows for an effective visual on the site as well as guides the user to which building they need to go.  For the user who is not familiar with the campus layout, upon arriving at this central bus stop location they will intuitively know where to go as a result of these lines.  The lines point to the center of Salt Lake City (2.69 miles away), the Library (856 feet away), the Museum (298 feet away), the Stadium (1737 feet away), to the physical Salt Lake (18.45 miles away), the Church (1100 feet away), the Light Rail (880 feet away), the Hunt Center (1045 feet away) and the Hospital (1350 feet away).  \r\n',597,'2009-09-11 23:41:16','2009-09-11 23:41:16','Perspective.png','image/png',1099959,'2009-09-11 23:41:07','Main.png','image/png',696492,'2009-09-11 23:41:11','Section1.png','image/png',306481,'2009-09-11 23:41:14',197,'24.180.7.51'),(215,'Next Stop in Motion','The concept for the “Next Stop Design” was derived from an Olympic downhill speed skier.

Thin slices of scrap vinyl weave to create weather tight skin.  Larger slices of recylced vinyl are oriented, sliced and coupled to make a honey patterned roof.  To comply with honeycomb scraps, a generative creation of cells creats a molded component system that can be assembled through 100% vinyl means.  Completing the roof, translucent vinyl coats non-conventional photovoltaic cells like a crown.  In opposition, PVC piping of various sizes cradle the delicate structure of the roof and generate the main structure.  These function as multi use in roof, floor, and furniture.  Floor bends to form wall, and chair becomes counter display.  Various types of generic transformable joints are constructed to facilitate the connection of difficult angles.

The street side is active; therefore, the bus stop begins to expand and contract depending on its use, whereas the rear is contained and only allows for views into the space.  Near the street edge a low wall acts as a protective barrier against oncoming traffic  - this same wall also features an LED display that notifies commuters of the estimated arrival time of the buses or upcoming delays.\r\n\r\nThe seating and standing area is covered to protect commuters from the natural elements because that area has a long-term use.  The information and ticket kiosk is the opposite - this area is used during short amounts of time and therefore remains uncovered.  The canopy of the bus stop is broken into two parts: (1) above the standing area, the canopy is solid with recessed lighting for use at night, and (2) above the seating area, the canopy opens up and the structural members are exposed, allowing natural light to filter through.  On the top of the canopy, photovoltaic panels convert the sun\'s energy into electricity, which is used to light the bus stop during darkness and to power the information booth.  Rainwater is collected in a trough and is harvested to hydrate the surrounding landscape.\r\n\r\nA small garden is used to connect the programmatic zones and brings a natural element to the bus stop.  Using plants such as Karl Foerster or Stipa Tenuissima, the garden will be easy to maintain and drought tolerant during all seasons.  By allowing the plants to grow to full size, they will help define the rear of the bus stop and add movement between the screens.\r\n\r\nThe choice and placement of material were determined base on use.  The shell of the bus stop would be cast-in-place concrete using recylced aggregates.  Recyled wood is used for seating and screening, providing a warm and fine texture.  An unglazed porcelain tile - which has a recyled content, no additives, colorants, resins, VOCs or toxins - is used for the paving to providing a durable, high-impact, slip, scratch, stain and fade-resistant surface.  By using a combination of recyclable materials, we are able to help reduce the amount of waste in our landfills.

For some, A bus stop is merely a place to stand out of the sun or the rain.  For others, it is a place to relax for a few minutes between the day\'s tasks.  A bus stop can also serve as a physical landmark or a place to reorient oneself.  The elements of thermal comfort, transparency, visibility, lighting, constructability, and sustainability should be well considered.  With this in mind, many bus stop designs fall into one of two categories.  There are those that focus strictly on function and those that strive too hard to make a formal statement.  The \"Smart Stop\" in not formally aggressive, but it is quite sophisticated in its detailing and its response to fuction and use.  \r\n \r\nWaiting in a public place with strangers can be awkward experience.  transparent or translucent glass is used as a primary cladding material for this very reason.  The glass provides shelter from the wind, rain, and street activity, and it also allows for visual access and ventilation.  \r\n \r\nThe \"Smart Stop\" responds the issues of thermal comfort and lighting quite well.  Photovoltaic panels provide shade for bus stop users on hot days, and they power four radiant heat panels on colder days.  A significant portion of the lighting load is powered by the photovoltaics making the structure largely self sufficient and sustainable.  Adequete lighting is particularly important to the safety of nighttime users.    \r\n \r\nAlthough the detailing of the \"Smart Stop\" is quite complex, the basic structure makes use of standard steel components such as galvanized steel tubes.  Many of the components could be prefabricated and assembled onsite for ease of construction.  \r\n \r\nFinally, all bus stops must find a way to become physical landmarks.  They must be visible without being too \"loud\".  The \"Smart Stop\" does just that.  With the use of color, graphics, and signage, bus stop users can locate the stop easily and orient themselves to this location.  The slight taper to roof allows rainwater runoff into a garden of sorts that helps bring the design down to the scale of the pedestrian and blend it with its context.  \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n',2225,'2009-09-23 04:53:45','2009-09-23 04:53:45','Board_3-raster.jpg','image/pjpeg',848299,'2009-09-23 04:52:47','Board_2.jpg','image/pjpeg',638343,'2009-09-23 04:53:07','Board_1.jpg','image/pjpeg',1083073,'2009-09-23 04:53:22',248,'208.107.71.64'),(267,'Bus_Stop','Bus_Stop_Design',2269,'2009-09-23 11:57:15','2009-09-23 11:57:15','Bus_Stop.jpg','image/pjpeg',419709,'2009-09-23 11:57:09',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,249,'89.53.208.150'),(268,'Bus Hub by MADdesigns','INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe concept for this bus stop/hub is to provide a busy university bus route with a stylish and recognisable bus shelter that is a landmark for the university students and can be used as a meeting place.\r\n\r\nThe design lends itself to the new build and the recycled build - the random design of the glazing gives the opportunity for the use of recycled glazing to be used instead of new glazing.

In line with such an initiative this bus stop is an eco-friendly, practical and durable structure that encourages the use of public transport.

Furthermore, there is easy access to and from the bus stop facilitating the needs of the disabled or parents with pushchairs.\r\n\r\nThe natural elements are also incorporated into the design via the use of solar cells that run either side of the structural spine. These solar cells power multiple lights that run parallel to them. The lights indicate how soon the next bus will take to arrive. That is, when the bus leaves all lights will be dimmed down. The lights will then gradually light up one by one until the next bus arrives. This ingenious design almost eliminates the need for a timetable for passengers will be able to see how long it will be before the next bus arrives, even from a considerable distance. \r\n\r\nThe structure is made from steel chain-link that allows flexibility for movement. The outer skin is comprised from translucent, recycled, industrial rubber. Such material protects the core of the structure whilst also enhancing flexibility of movement. \r\n\r\nDigital images can be displayed on the upper two thirds of the structure including the usual bus timetables and advertising billboards. However, why not be a bit more adventurous and utilise the space as an exhibition area for local artists or even enable individuals to upload images from their phones or laptops themselves. The possibilities really are endless here. \r\n\r\nThis is a bus stop so incredible it could be listed as a destination on the bus route itself!\r\n',2320,'2009-09-23 18:25:31','2009-09-23 18:25:31','Next_stop_design_sheet_1_.jpg','image/jpeg',1245508,'2009-09-23 18:25:18','Next_stop_design_sheet_2_.jpg','image/jpeg',995233,'2009-09-23 18:25:25',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,255,'78.146.194.141'),(274,'Green Gateway bus shelter','The design has been inspired by the open landscape that surrounds Salt Lake City, highlighting the importance of sustainability in a climate with extreme weather conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe shelter acts as a landmark by its streamlined form shaped like an arch, as the symbol of an entrance/exit to the campus site and merging with the landscape surrounding salt lake city.\r\n\r\nOne side of the bus shelter is closed loop water feature, which mimics the waterfalls in the nearby mountains.

About This Website\r\n\r\nThis website is part of a research project called \"Crowdsourcing Public Participation in Transit Planning.\" Traditionally, government agencies ask for public input on planning projects by holding open meetings and workshops. The purpose of this project is to get this public input in a different way: online.\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration between the \"Department of City & Metropolitan Planning\":http://cmpweb.arch.utah.edu/ and \"Department of Communication\":http://communication.utah.edu/ at the \"University of Utah\":http://www.utah.edu and the \"Utah Transit Authority\":http://www.rideuta.com. The project is supported by \"U.S. Federal Transit Administration grant 2008-DOT-FTA-PTPP: Innovative Small Research Projects to Advance Public Participation Related to Public Transportation Planning\":http://www.fta.dot.gov/planning/programs/planning_environment_5925.html.\r\n\r\nh1. About Our Initial Bus Stop Site\r\n\r\nWe are currently designing for a specific bus stop location. \"Click here\":http://www.nextstopdesign.com/about/site/ to learn about this location, the weather, download photos, and more.\r\n\r\nh1. Design Considerations\r\n\r\nWhenever you design something, you\'re not figuring out how it looks as much as you are how it works. How well it works means taking things into consideration that you might not initially think about. To help out, we\'ve put together a list of design considerations for you. Take a look and see if it helps you design a better bus stop. \"Design Considerations\":http://www.nextstopdesign.com/about/considerations/\r\n\r\nh1. Design Tools\r\n\r\n\"Here\'s a list of some tools and downloads\":http://www.nextstopdesign.com/about/tools/ that you might find helpful when designing your bus stop. Have fun.\r\n\r\nh1. Questions?

Designs with at least 25 votes are eligible to win the competition. Highest rated eligible designs by the competition closing date will win.\r\n\r\nTerms of Use\r\n \r\nWelcome! By using the Next Stop Design project web site (the “Website”) you agree to operate under the following terms and conditions, which include this Terms of Use, the \"Privacy Policy and Information Collection Statement\":privacy-policy, the Community Code of Conduct, and the directions on Providing Notice of Copyright Violations Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (together, the “Terms of Use”). \r\n \r\nh3. Project Overview\r\n \r\nThe Next Stop Design Website enables third parties (“Contributors”) to provide design submissions and commentary relating the design of a bus stop for the Utah Transit Authority. This Website represents a public participation activity to get input on transit planning issues. \r\n \r\nh3. Privacy Policy\r\n \r\nThe Next Stop Design project strongly believes in the importance of Contributor privacy as a fundamental design philosophy. Please review the \"Privacy Policy and Information Collection Statement\":privacy-policy.\r\n \r\nh2. Code of Conduct\r\n \r\nContributors to the Website are expected to know these requirements and to follow them in all circumstances. \r\nWe hope that you will have a rewarding experience. \r\n \r\nh3. 1.0 Interactions with other Peers/Contributors \r\n \r\n1.1 Assume Good Faith \r\nAssume that Contributors to the Website are trying to help it, not hurt it. Enabling a larger and more diverse community to submit designs, ideas, and comments will better inform transit planners. Better information results in higher quality bus stops. \r\n \r\n1.2 Civility \r\nContributors shall participate with decorum and courtesy. Contributors shall not behave or communicate in a rude, insensitive, or petty manner. Contributors shall refrain from offending others as well as discourage others from being uncivil. Contributors shall refrain from unwanted communication with other Contributors outside the context of the Website. Contributors shall not make personal attacks anywhere on the Website. Personal attacks damage the community and deter participation. \r\n \r\n1.3 Educate Yourself for Participation \r\nNext Stop Design contains educational materials to help prepare Contributors for submitting designs and ideas. Please make use of these materials, consistent with your background, to optimize the effectiveness of your contributions. \r\n \r\n1.4 Commercial Solicitation\r\nNo Contributor shall use the Website to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation, including, but not limited to, solicitation of Contributors to become subscribers of other web sites. \r\n \r\n2.0 Disclosure and Self-Identifcation \r\nPlease also see the \"Privacy Policy and Information Collection Statement\":privacy-policy for information about privacy and confidentiality of postings on the Website.\r\n \r\n2.1 Contributor Account \r\nContributors shall register one and only one account. Contributors may not use multiple accounts to create the illusion of greater support for or criticism against a submission, or to mislead in any way. \r\n \r\n2.2 Username \r\nContributors shall register under their own name or a neutral pseudonym. Contributors are encouraged (but not required) to register under their own names; by appearing with a name rather than a pseudonym, Contributors help to create a strong community.\r\n \r\nPseudonyms shall not be misleading, offensive or infringing. A pseudonym should not be the name of another natural person, nor be designed to mislead in any way. \r\n \r\n3.0 Providing Commentary\r\n \r\n3.1 Moderators\r\nThe Website is moderated by the Next Stop Design researchers, which reserves the right to not post or to remove content with or without notice to the Contributor posting the content. Offensive and commercial content, including spam, will be removed. \r\n \r\n3.2 Posting, in General \r\nContributors shall post designs, ideas, and comments in a specific, neutral, objective, and reasonable manner. These postings are intended to put forth new ideas or to constructively critique others\' designs. Postings are not intended as a personal critique of the submitters. Postings should be written in such a way as to guide and inform Contributors so that they, or others, may submit improved designs.\r\n \r\n3.3 Scoring \r\nContributors may score any design once. Attempting a second vote will replace the Contributor\'s previous vote with the new one.\r\n \r\nh2. Providing Notice of Copyright Violations Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)\r\n \r\nNext Stop Design, a project of the University of Utah in cooperation with the Utah Transit Authority (“we”), will respond to allegations of copyright violations on www.nextstopdesign.com (the “Website”) pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 USC 512.\r\n \r\nThe DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notification to an online service provider concerning alleged copyright infringement.

The university has about 30,000 students and 18,000 employees.\r\n\r\nThe bus stop is a busy and important transfer stop for several city bus routes, as well as campus shuttles, and there is considerable foot traffic around the stop. Many students and employees at the University of Utah commute to and from campus via the bus and the nearby light rail train. The stop is located on a small street that loops into the campus (also known as the \"Business Loop\") off of a major road. This street, though small, experiences steady vehicular traffic, and a pedestrian crosswalk guides individuals on the sidewalk across this small street to the bus stop.\r\n\r\nSalt Lake City\'s summers are hot and dry and winters are moderate with snow. Near downtown Salt Lake City, the university campus is at a higher elevation part-way up a mountain and thus receives a bit more snow in the winter than downtown. At this bus stop, most types of weather conditions will exist in a given year--heat, cold, snow, rain, wind, and harsh sunlight. \"Click here\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Salt_Lake_City for more information on the climate of Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n<b>General Design Considerations for Bus Stops</b>\r\nThere is a lot to think about when designing a functional bus stop.

Background\r\n\r\nNext Stop Design is part of a research project by a team of researchers at the University of Utah, in cooperation with the Utah Transit Authority and funded by a grant from the U.S. Federal Transit Administration. The purpose of the project is to use the Web to bring in new voices and different ideas to the public participation process for transit planning. The site is designed to test the \"crowdsourcing model\":http://www.nextstopdesign.com/press#crowdsourcing as a way to improve this public participation process.\r\n\r\nThe research team applied for \"Federal Transit Administration grant 2008-DOT-FTA-PTPP: Innovative Small Research Projects to Advance Public Participation Related to Public Transportation Planning\":http://www.fta.dot.gov/planning/programs/planning_environment_5925.html and were awarded a grant. The first round of testing involves the design of a bus stop for the University of Utah campus\' \"business loop,\" a major transfer stop for the area.\r\n\r\nThe hope is that Next Stop Design will shed light on the ways people participate in government decision making and design activities--such as bus stop design--online, and that similar projects can be undertaken to solve other public problems and needs.\r\n\r\n<a id=\"crowdsourcing\" name=\"crowdsourcing\"></a>\r\n\r\nh2. What is Crowdsourcing?\r\n\r\nCrowdsourcing is an online, distributed problem solving and production model. \"Coined in June 2006\":http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html by <i>Wired</i> magazine contributing editor Jeff Howe, \"crowdsourcing\" refers to an open creative process combined with a centralized, managed production and implementation process. Crowdsourcing is similar to--but certainly not the same as--open source production.\r\n\r\nThe crowdsourcing model is most notably a for-profit model used by companies such as \"Threadless,\":http://www.threadless.com \"InnoCentive,\":http://www.innocentive.com and in contests such as the \"Goldcorp Challenge\":http://goldcorpchallenge.com and user-generated advertising campaigns. The \"Peer to Patent Community Patent Review\":http://peertopatent.org project is a non-profit, government example of crowdsourcing, using the power of the crowd to make the patent application review process more efficient for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\r\n\r\n!http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Crowdsourcing_process2.jpg/350px-Crowdsourcing_process2.jpg!:http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Crowdsourcing_process2.jpg/750px-Crowdsourcing_process2.jpg\r\n\r\nUnderpinning the crowdsourcing model is the notion of collective intelligence, which assumes a base of talent in a large network, as well as \"crowd wisdom,\" which suggests that the aggregate of individual ideas in a crowd is often quite valuable. Next Stop Design is an attempt to leverage the collective intelligence of an online community for public good, to crowdsource a public design problem to citizens in an innovative way. The hope is to translate the lessons learned from innovative Web-based business practices into problem solving tools for the greater good.\r\n\r\n<a id=\"team\" name=\"team\"></a>\r\n\r\nh2.
